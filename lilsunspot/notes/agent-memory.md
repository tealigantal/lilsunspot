# Agent Memory

## 2026-06-04

- Task: close `LIL-00-04` after real local-environment chat validation.
- Files touched: `TASKS.md`, `lilsunspot/notes/agent-memory.md`.
- Decision/result: `LIL-00-04` moved to Done and `LIL-00-05` is now Current.
- Validation: using local environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `/providers/test` passed for `deepseek/deepseek-chat`, and `/chat/send` returned a real `hermes_runtime_adapter` response with 39 characters. `python scripts/guard_no_secrets.py` and `pwsh scripts/check.ps1` passed locally.
- Remaining risk: no API Key, runtime token, or reply body was recorded; GitHub PR creation still requires local `gh auth login`.
